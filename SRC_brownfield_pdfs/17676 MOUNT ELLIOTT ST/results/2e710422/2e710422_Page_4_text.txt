2.2  REMEDIAL EXCAVATION 
On  January  31,  2018  ERG  began  cutting and  breaking  the  concrete in  the  building  above  the  UST  and 
excavating the soil above the UST.  
The soils encountered consisted of brown, fine- to medium-grained sand throughout the UST basin, to 
approximately  8.5  feet  below  grade  level  (bgl).  ERG  continually  screened  soils  removed  from  the 
excavation for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using a photo-ionization detector (PID). Elevated PID 
levels and petroleum odors was observed below the south end of the UST, approximately 7.5 feet bgl, 
although the PID levels lessened in depth as the excavation continued. Groundwater was not encountered 
during excavation. 
Once the UST was exposed a hole was cut into the tank to determine the contents. It appeared to be filled 
with soil or flowable fill, and caused the gas monitor to alarm for elevated levels of hydrogen sulfide. The 
building was evacuated, and proper PPE was provided to sample the UST contents before work continued. 
The  sample  was  sent  to  Lakeland  Laboratories,  Inc.,  located  in  Pinckney  Michigan  and  analyzed  for 
reactivity and flashpoint. The results were non-detect and removal activities continued February 1, 2018. 
The laboratory report is included in Attachment D.  
The UST was removed from the ground and transported off-site. The tank was in fair condition with several 
small holes on the bottom near the southern portion of the tank.  
The excavation continued where safely and feasibly possible until screening samples indicated VOC levels 
no greater than 50 ppm. Structural safety concerns with site building limited the northern and eastern 
extent  in  that  area  of  the  excavation.  The  excavation  was  stopped  at  8.5  feet  bgl.  Table  1,  below, 
summarizes the field screening sampling that guided the excavation.

2.0  EXCAVATION OF CONTAMINATED SOIL 
2.1  PROJECT SETUP 
To complete the project goals, ERG developed and submitted a Work Plan to the MDEQ on January 5, 
2018. The work plan was implemented in January 2018 as described in the following sections: 
2.1.1  PRELIMINARY SITE VISIT 
A preliminary site visit and meeting with the property owner was conducted on January 29, 2018. Prior to 
the meeting, ERG reviewed the preliminary scope of work and proposed soil excavation locations. During 
the  meeting  with  Erik  Gurshaw  of  the  MDEQ,  the  excavation  area  was  marked,  and  site  access  was 
determined.  
2.1.2  NOTIFICATIONS / WASTE APPROVALS 
In advance of performing any on-site field activities, the following notices and waste disposal actions were 
completed. 
•
ERG  submitted  a  notification  to  the  Department  of  Licensing  and  Regulatory  Affairs  (LARA)  of
Intent of Removal of UST prior to commencing removal and excavation activities at the site.
ERG completed a waste disposal profile with two Type II sanitary landfills for disposal approval for
the  petroleum  impacted  soils  to  be  generated  during  the  UST  removal  /  remedial  excavation
activities. Based on the transportation logistics related to landfill location in relation to backfill
material locations, Waste Management was selected as the disposal facility for the impacted soils.
•
Following UST removal and excavation activities, ERG mailed the Underground Storage Tank System Site 
Assessment Report, form BFS-3881, to LARA on March 12, 2018. See Attachment B.

B AKTPEERLESS

Cc. Provide the calculations and reference citations supporting the development of the
relevant Tier II or Tier III SSTLs.

Not applicable.

D. Provide a table which compares the maximum remaining contaminant
concentrations for each required parameter for all media to the appropriate RBSLs
and the calculated SSTLs. Identify all applicable land use scenario(s), and indicate
whether or not there is an exceedance of the RBSLs or the SSTLs.

Not applicable.

6.3 MODELING

Contaminant plume fate and transport modeling was not conducted as part of this assessment.

7.0 CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN
71 DESCRIPTION OF THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN

A. Describe the corrective action to be implemented at the facility and the anticipated
cleanup goals.

Remedial excavation of approximately 10 cubic yards of soil occurred during UST removal.
Verification of soil remediation (VSR), in accordance with Sampling Strategies and Statistics
Training Materials S3TM, soil samples were collected and submitted for laboratory analysis.
Based on the results, no further corrective action is necessary.

B. Attach a schematic drawing of the remedial system to be employed.

Not applicable.

Cc; Provide site maps and diagrams depicting capture zones/zones of influence, system
layout, and anticipated system injection and/or extraction rates.

Not applicable.

D. Provide a contingency plan to be implemented if the corrective action is ineffective.

Not applicable.

7.2 AIR QUALITY MONITORING

Describe the ambient or indoor air quality monitoring that will be conducted during the
implementation of the corrective action and include the following: (1) Air sampling
locations, (2) Analytical parameters to be monitored, (3) The action level for each
parameter, and the basis for the action level, (4) The monitoring device(s) to be used, (5)
The monitoring frequency, and (6) The procedure that will be followed if the action level(s)
is/are exceeded.

Not applicable.

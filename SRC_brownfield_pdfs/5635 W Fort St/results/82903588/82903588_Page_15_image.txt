§ AKTPEERLESS

I. Identify any known soil contamination not related to the release, and the source if
known.

AKT Peerless did not observe, identify, or detect soil contamination not related to the release
confirmed from the former UST system at the site.
4.55 ©GROUNDWATER CONDITIONS & CHARACTERISTICS

A. Describe the site hydrogeology, and include the following:

1. Depth to groundwater and method of determination.

Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

2. Whether the groundwater is potable and/or not in an aquifer. Provide the basis for
this determination.

Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

3. Whether the groundwater is currently used as a source of drinking water, either
residential or municipal.

Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities. Groundwater from the area
of the subject property does not serve as the primary drinking water source for properties in
Detroit, which obtains its municipal water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department
(DWSD). Public sources of information do not identify main aquifers below the subject
property.

4. Whether groundwater is being used for a purpose other than drinking water.

Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

5. Whether more than one groundwater unit is present beneath the site.

Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

6. Depth to bottom of water-bearing layer.

Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

7. Predominant soil type in water-bearing stratum (e.g., sand, silt).

Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

8. Effective porosity of water-bearing stratum (in em3void/em3matrix), and describe
how it was determined.

Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

9. Groundwater flow rate and direction.

Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

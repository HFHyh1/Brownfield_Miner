4.0 SITE CHARACTERIZATION INFORMATION
4.1 SCALED SITE MAPS

A. Provide a scaled area map (or maps) which include the following:
1. Site boundaries in relation to the surrounding area and the nearest major roads;

Refer to Figures 1 and 2.

2. Location and depth of nearby underground sewers and utility lines;

Refer to Figure 2.

3; Location of nearby surface waters or wetlands;

The nearest surface water body is the Detroit River, which is located approximately 0.25 miles
south of the subject property. There are no wetlands near the subject property. Refer to Figure
1p

4. Location and screened depth of all off-site wells (municipal, residential, production,
irrigation, etc.) within two years groundwater travel time of the property line, which
may be dependent on the pumping rates of the identified well(s).

Not applicable. Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

5. Location of all nearby delineated well-head protection areas.
There are no wellhead protection areas near the subject property.
B. Provide a scaled site map (or maps) which includes the following:

1. Location of fill ports, piping, dispensers, and other pertinent system components for
all UST systems currently or formerly at the facility (prior to excavation if tanks
have been removed);

Piping and dispensers were not identified during the UST removal. The fill port was located

above the UST. Refer to Figures 4 and 5.

2. Location of the release and the component of the LUST system from which the
release occurred;

The release was associated with the UST. Refer to Figure 4.

3. Location of adjacent buildings, roadways, paved areas, or other structures;

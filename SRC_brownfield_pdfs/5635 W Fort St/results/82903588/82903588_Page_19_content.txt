a Potential exposure route(s)

Exposure Routes

Is Exposure Route Potentially Complete
(Yes or No)

Soil

Ingestion

No — contaminant concentrations are below criteria

Groundwater

Dermal Contact

No — groundwater was not encountered

Ingestion

No — groundwater was not encountered

No

4. Potential receptor(s)

The closest receptor is the Detroit River, which is located approximately 0.25 miles south of the
subject property. Groundwater was not encountered during the UST removal activities.
Therefore, it is not anticipated that contaminant movement is present.

B. Indicate which pathways are newly identified or have significantly changed since the
submission of the [AR. Describe these pathways and any potential impact on the
selection of exposure route(s) and potential receptors for this RBCA evaluation

relative to the RBCA evaluation included in the [AR.

An Initial Assessment Report was not submitted for this site.

B AKTPEERLESS

9.0 CLOSURE STATEMENT

The results of AKT Peerless’ soil sampling activities conducted subsequent to the removal of the
UST system did not identify the presence of chemicals of concern at concentrations above
applicable MDEQ Part 213 Tier I RBSLs (Residential Cleanup Criteria); therefore, no further
evaluation of the study area soil is necessary.

Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.
Based on the subsurface investigations conducted at the subject property, the confirmed release

has been adequately addressed and should be considered for “Residential Closure” under Part
213 of the National Resources and Environmental Protection Act, 1994 PA 451, as amended.

4. Location of all on-site wells and screened intervals;

Not applicable.

5. Location of soil, groundwater, surface water, sediment, or air samples, as
applicable;

Refer to Figures 3 through 5.

6. Excavation dimensions and sample locations if applicable.

Refer to Figure 3.
4.2. SCALED CROSS-SECTIONAL DIAGRAMS

A Provide scaled cross-sectional diagrams of buried utility corridors, including the
pipe diameter, the type of backfill, and the trench depth.

Utilities were not encountered during the UST removal activities. Refer to Figure 2 for the
locations of the nearest identified utilities.

B Provide scaled cross-sectional diagrams depicting the soil lithology and the
contaminant distribution, including sampling intervals and boring depths.

Refer to Figures 4 and 5.

Cc Provide scaled cross-sectional diagrams depicting the site hydrogeology, including
the groundwater potentiometric surface, the monitoring well screened intervals, and
sampling intervals.

Not applicable. Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.
4.3. DELINEATION OF THE EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION

A. Indicate whether additional site assessment activities were conducted subsequent to
the submission of the IAR. If so, describe which environmental media were
investigated (e.g., soil, groundwater, surface water, air).

An Initial Assessment Report was not submitted.

B. Describe the assessment activities conducted. Indicate whether the Work Plan was
implemented as outlined in the IAR. If not, describe any changes made, and
provide a justification.

Summary of UST Removal Sampling Activities

On July 26, 2012, AKT Peerless collected eight soil samples from the UST cavity during UST
removal activities. The samples were submitted to an environmental laboratory for analysis of

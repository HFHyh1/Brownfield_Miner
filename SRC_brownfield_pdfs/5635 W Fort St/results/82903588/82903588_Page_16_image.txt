10. Lateral component of the hydraulic gradient.

Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

11. Hydrogeologic conditions that could influence flow direction.

The nearest surface water body that may influence the flow direction is the Detroit River, which
is located approximately 0.25 miles south of the subject property.

12. Magnitude and direction of the vertical component of the hydraulic gradient

Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities. Therefore, it is not
anticipated that vertical contaminant movement is present.

B. Attach copies of the following:
1 Boring logs not previously submitted.

Not applicable.

2. Well construction diagrams not previously submitted.

Not applicable.

3. Potentiometric surface map.

Not applicable.

4. Elevation data (USGS datum preferred), including top-of-casing and grade
elevations, and depth to groundwater.

Not applicable.

Cc. Provide scaled maps and cross-sectional diagrams, showing the screened and/or
sampling interval, which depict the extent of impact and the maximum
concentrations.

Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

D. Indicate whether more than one groundwater unit has been impacted.
Not applicable.
E. Describe any groundwater remediation activities performed subsequent to submittal

of the IAR, including the total volume of groundwater remediated and the
disposition of this groundwater.

Not applicable.
F. Indicate whether the plume currently extends off-site or is expected to migrate off-
site.

Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

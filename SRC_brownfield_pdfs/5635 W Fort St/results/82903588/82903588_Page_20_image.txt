Cc. List each possible exposure pathway(s) for each land use and sensitive habitat (if
applicable) for the site. Provide an explanation for eliminating any pathways.

Does Threat Exist to
MDEQ Exposure Pathway Potential Receptor(s) Explanation
(Yes or No)
Soil Exposure Pathways
Drinking Water Protection No Groundwater was not encountered during UST
(all land uses) removal activities. Groundwater from the area of
the subject property does not serve as the primary
drinking water source for properties in Detroit,
which obtains its municipal water from the
DWSD. Installation of drinking water wells are
prohibited in the City of Detroit.
GSI Protection No Groundwater was not encountered during UST
removal activities
Groundwater Contact Protection No Contaminant concentrations are below criteria.
Soil Volatilization to Indoor Air No Contaminant concentrations are below criteria.
Inhalation (all land uses)
Infinite Source VSIC No Contaminant concentrations are below criteria.
Particulate Soil Inhalation No Surface contamination is not present.
Direct Contact No Contaminant concentrations are below criteria.

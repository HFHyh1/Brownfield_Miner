8.2 GROUNDWATER CLOSURE VERIFICATION
A. Describe the groundwater verification sampling strategy applied at the site by
providing the following:

1. A scaled site map which identifies the former extent of groundwater contamination,
the groundwater verification sampling locations relative to existing site features,
and the groundwater flow direction(s).

Not applicable. Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.
2. A description of how the sampling frequency and duration of sampling for

groundwater verification purposes was established, if your sampling strategy differs
from the Storage Tank Division Operational Memorandum No. 9.

Not applicable. Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

3. A list of the analytical parameters used to verify groundwater closure.

Not applicable. Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

4. A justification if all groundwater verification samples were not analyzed, preserved,
and handled in accordance with the Storage Tank Division Operational

Memorandum No. 14, Analytical Parameters and Methods, Sample Handling, and
Preservation for Petroleum Releases.

Not applicable.

B. Provide a table with laboratory data showing the results of all verification
groundwater sampling performed for the required parameters. Refer to the
Storage Tank Division Operational Memorandum No. 14, Analytical Parameters
and Methods, Sample Handling, and Preservation for Petroleum Releases. The
table should include the following:

1. Sample ID

Not applicable. Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

2. Sample depth or screened interval

Not applicable. Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

3. Date of collection

Not applicable. Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

4. Dates of extraction and analysis

Not applicable. Groundwater was not encountered during UST removal activities.

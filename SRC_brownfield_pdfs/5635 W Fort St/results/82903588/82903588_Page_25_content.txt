Soil Closure Statement

The results of AKT Peerlessâ€™ soil sampling activities conducted subsequent to the removal of the
UST system did not identify the presence of chemicals of concern at concentrations above
applicable MDEQ Part 213 Tier I Residential Cleanup Criteria; therefore, no further evaluation
of the study area soil is necessary. Refer to Figures 3 and 6 and Table 1 for verification.

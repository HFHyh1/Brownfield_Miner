Definitions/ Qualifiers:

A: Spike recovery or precision unusable due to dilution.
B: The analyte was detected in the associated method blank.
E: The analyte was detected at a concentration greater than the calibration range, therefore the result is estimated.
J: The concentration is an estimated value.
M: Modified Method
U: The analyte was not detected at or above the reporting limit.
X: Matrix Interference has resulted in a raised reporting limit or distorted result.
W: Results reported on a wet-weight basis.
*: Value reported is outside QA limits
Exception Summary:
V- _: Recovery in the associated continuing calibration verification sample (CCV) exceeds the lower control limit. Results
may be biased low.
